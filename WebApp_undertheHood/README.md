# WebApp_undertheHood

A modern HR portal built using ASP.NET Core Razor Pages, styled with the Hollard brand colour scheme and designed following clean architecture principles.

## 🧱 Project Structure

This project follows a layered architecture:

- **Web**: Razor Pages UI
- **Application**: Business logic and service contracts
- **Domain**: Core entities and domain rules
- **Infrastructure**: External integrations (e.g., HTTP clients, database access)

## 🎨 Branding

The UI is styled using Hollard's official brand colours:

- **Primary (Jacarta Purple)**: `#4A2767`
- **Secondary (Sandy Brown)**: `#F8996D`
- **Accent (Pomegranate)**: `#E94E0F`

These are defined in `site.css` using CSS variables for consistency and maintainability.

## 🚀 Features

- Responsive login form with loading animation
- Modular Razor Pages with partial views
- Structured logging and error handling
- Clean separation of concerns
- Custom animations (`fade-in-up`, `pulse-on-hover`)
- Integrated validation and feedback
- Uses `IHttpClientFactory` and Polly for resilience (planned)

## 🧪 Testing

- Unit tests using **TUnit** and **FluentAssertions**
- Integration tests mirror the `src/` structure
- End-to-end UI tests planned with **Playwright**

## 🛠️ Technologies

- ASP.NET Core 8 (LTS)
- Razor Pages
- C# 12
- Bootstrap 5
- JavaScript (for async login UX)
- CSS3 with custom variables
- EditorConfig for consistent styling
